ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
This software is free for students and anyone working on a non-commercial apps/games. However, for pay based content, you must have a dev blog that regularly teaches and talks about the development process. At least 50% of your code base must be open source. It is intended for learning.  This section will update later, and I am looking for a better/more clear description.
